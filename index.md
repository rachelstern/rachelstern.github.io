## Welcome!
### Overview
I'm a clinician educator, primary care provider and hospitalist at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. I serve as the Assistant Director for Quality and Systems Improvement at our safety net internal medicine resident teaching clinic. My interests include primary care quality improvement as a tool to improve health equity, teaching QI and developing the next generation of safety net leaders, and healing transitions between the hospital and the community.  
  
My current projects include improving ambulatory chronic disease management, co-directing our resident QI and leadership curriculum, a heart failure readmission reduction project and serving as an editor for [AHRQ's PSNet.](https://psnet.ahrq.gov){:target="_blank"}
